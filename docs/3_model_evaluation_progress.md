the output for decisions.

| Rank | Notebook | Submission Name | Local Validation MCC | Public MCC | Private MCC | Decision |
| ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | `5_type_specific_thresholds.ipynb` | Type-Specific Thresh, Version 3 | 0.67650 | 0.65170 | 0.65127 | Current scored champion |
| 2 | `7_blended_type_models.ipynb` | Blended type models | 0.67944 | Pending | Pending | Submit challenger |
| 3 | `6_type_specific_models.ipynb` | Type-Specific Model, Version 2 | 0.67530 | 0.65212 | 0.64025 | Rejected: private regression |
| 4 | `4_nearest_player_and_smoothing.ipynb` | Nearest Player, Version 3 | 0.67455 | 0.64497 | 0.64763 | Superseded |
| 5 | `3_tracking_feature_model.ipynb` | Tracking Feature, Version 3 | 0.65310 | 0.63075 | 0.62593 | Superseded |

Notebook 3 is the first scored model. Its public/private gap is small
(`0.00482`), which suggests the model generalizes reasonably across leaderboard
splits. Local validation is optimistic by about `0.022` to `0.027` MCC.

Notebook 5 is now the scored champion. It improved over Notebook 4 by
`+0.00673` public MCC and `+0.00364` private MCC.

## 2. Champion Diagnostics

Notebook 3 local validation by contact type:

| Contact Type | Local MCC | Actual Rate | Predicted Rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ground | 0.41231 | 3.47% | 2.90% |
| Player-player | 0.71656 | 1.02% | 1.36% |

Interpretation:

- Player-player contact is the model's strongest slice.
- Ground contact is the biggest weakness and should drive the next feature
  work.
- The model's validation is useful for ranking ideas, but public/private scores
  should be used to confirm final submission decisions.

## 3. Active Challenger

| Notebook | Status | Goal | Submit If |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `7_blended_type_models.ipynb` | Local validation improved | Blend the stable unified model with type-specific models before smoothing and threshold tuning | Submit as the next leaderboard challenger; keep Notebook 5 selected until public/private confirm it |
| `8_yolo_video_feature_probe.ipynb` | EDA/video probe | Inspect frame sync, helmet overlays, CPU YOLO install/download research mode, and cheap helmet geometry features | Do not submit directly; use findings to decide whether Notebook 9 should add video features |

Notebook 4 targeted two likely weaknesses:

- local density: contact risk depends on nearest teammate/opponent context;
- label noise: contact labels may be offset by roughly one 10 Hz timestep, so
  probability smoothing can help if the threshold is retuned on held-out plays.

Notebook 4 validation details:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Best smoothing window | 5 |
| Best threshold | 0.59 |
| Local validation MCC | 0.67455 |
| Precision | 0.59742 |
| Recall | 0.77176 |
| F1 | 0.67349 |
| Predicted positive rate | 1.59% |
| Submission positive rate | 2.09% |

Notebook 4 local validation by contact type:

| Contact Type | Local MCC | Actual Rate | Predicted Rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ground | 0.50623 | 3.47% | 3.87% |
| Player-player | 0.72226 | 1.02% | 1.37% |

Notebook 5 improved this by keeping the ground threshold at `0.59` and raising
the player-player threshold to `0.70`. The gain came from player-player
precision: player-player local MCC rose from `0.72226` to `0.72836`, while
ground local MCC stayed at `0.50623`.

Notebook 5 validation details:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Best smoothing window | 5 |
| Best ground threshold | 0.59 |
| Best player-player threshold | 0.70 |
| Local validation MCC | 0.67650 |
| Predicted positive rate | 1.38% |
| Submission positive rate | 1.92% |

Notebook 5 local validation by contact type:

| Contact Type | Local MCC | Actual Rate | Predicted Rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ground | 0.50623 | 3.47% | 3.87% |
| Player-player | 0.72836 | 1.02% | 1.15% |

Notebook 6 tested full model separation. It raised public MCC slightly but
dropped private MCC sharply, so it should not be selected:

| Metric | Notebook 5 | Notebook 6 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Local validation MCC | 0.67650 | 0.67530 |
| Public MCC | 0.65170 | 0.65212 |
| Private MCC | 0.65127 | 0.64025 |
| Ground local MCC | 0.50623 | 0.49675 |
| Player-player local MCC | 0.72836 | 0.72869 |
| Submission positive rate | 1.92% | 2.04% |

Interpretation: Notebook 6 mostly preserved player-player behavior, but the
ground model became less stable. The public/private split suggests overfitting
to the public holdout or a distribution mismatch in the separated ground model.

Notebook 7 tests a safer version of this idea by blending Notebook 5's unified
probabilities with Notebook 6-style type-specific probabilities. The goal is to
capture any player-player lift without allowing the ground model to fully
replace the more stable unified model.

Notebook 7 has now cleared the first local gate:

| Metric | Notebook 5 | Notebook 7 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Local validation MCC | 0.67650 | 0.67944 |
| Best smoothing window | 5 | 5 |
| Ground threshold | 0.59 | 0.59 |
| Player-player threshold | 0.70 | 0.63 |
| Submission positive rate | 1.92% | 1.99% |

Interpretation: the blended model improves local MCC while keeping the same
ground threshold and a similar submission positive rate. It is a reasonable
next Kaggle submission, but Notebook 5 should remain the selected champion
until Notebook 7's private score is known.

The Team Hydrogen 2nd-place writeup suggests the next major gains probably come
from video-aware modeling rather than more small tabular threshold changes. The
near-term version for this repo is not a full CNN ensemble yet; it is a
helmet/video feature probe followed by cheap video-derived features if the EDA
shows separation.

## 4. Evaluation Rules

Use this decision order for new experiments:

1. Compare grouped local validation MCC against the current champion.
2. Check contact-type slices, especially ground-contact MCC.
3. Check predicted positive rate against the validation positive rate.
4. Submit only if validation improves or the slice tradeoff is clearly useful.
5. After submission, record public and private MCC here before starting the
   next experiment.

## 5. Backlog

| Priority | Experiment | Reason |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Submit Notebook 7 | Local MCC rose to `0.67944`; leaderboard scores decide whether it replaces Notebook 5. |
| 2 | Run Notebook 8 YOLO/video probe | Tests frame sync, helmet overlays, and whether optional YOLO adds information beyond helmet boxes. |
| 3 | Helmet visibility features | Baseline helmet boxes can provide posture, occlusion, and pixel-distance proxies. |
| 4 | Short-window features around `t-2` to `t+2` | Contact labels are noisy and contact evolves over adjacent steps. |
| 5 | Multi-fold grouped validation | Team Hydrogen used grouped CV; this would reduce single-split volatility before heavier models. |
| 6 | Stage-2 blend | Use tracking probabilities plus selected distance/position/window features only after OOF predictions exist. |
