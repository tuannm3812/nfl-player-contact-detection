This repository contains a notebook-first workflow for Kaggle's
**NFL Player Contact Detection** competition. The task is to identify moments
when a player is in contact with another player or with the ground by combining
Next Gen Stats tracking data, baseline helmet detections, video metadata, and
contact labels.

Expected Kaggle input path is resolved automatically from the competition mount.
The notebooks check the current Kaggle slug first and keep the older starter
notebook slug as a fallback:

```text
/kaggle/input/1st-and-future-player-contact-detection
/kaggle/input/nfl-player-contact-detection
```

Input files:

- `train_labels.csv`: contact labels for player-player and player-ground pairs.
- `train_player_tracking.csv`: 10 Hz training tracking data.
- `test_player_tracking.csv`: 10 Hz test tracking data.
- `train_baseline_helmets.csv`: baseline helmet boxes for training videos.
- `test_baseline_helmets.csv`: baseline helmet boxes for test videos.
- `train_video_metadata.csv`: video timing metadata.
- `sample_submission.csv`: exhaustive test `contact_id` rows.

## Notebook Workflow

| Notebook | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `1_eda_contact_tracking_video_context.ipynb` | Data quality, contact label balance, tracking context, helmet/video metadata checks, and distance-baseline validation. |
| `2_distance_baseline_first_experiment.ipynb` | Reusable first experiment based on the starter notebook: tune a player-player distance threshold with MCC and write `submission.csv`. |

## Current Modeling Direction

The first experiment uses only player tracking distance. It is deliberately
simple and submission-safe:

1. Parse `contact_id` into `game_play`, `step`, `nfl_player_id_1`, and
   `nfl_player_id_2`.
2. Merge tracking coordinates for both players.
3. Predict player-player contact when Euclidean distance is below a tuned yard
   threshold.
4. Predict no ground contact in this baseline, then improve that branch in the
   next experiment using body/helmet/video features.

The competition metric is Matthews Correlation Coefficient, so notebooks should
report MCC for hard predictions instead of optimizing accuracy.
