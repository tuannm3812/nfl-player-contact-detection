This repository contains a notebook-first workflow for Kaggle's
**NFL Player Contact Detection** competition. The goal is to detect external
contact between NFL players, and between players and the ground, using tracking
data, baseline helmet detections, video metadata, and contact labels.

The current scored champion is a tracking-only model with nearest-player
context, temporal smoothing, and separate ground/player-player thresholds.
Notebook 7 is the active local challenger, and Notebook 8 starts the video/YOLO
investigation path.

## Current Best Result

| Rank | Notebook | Submission | Local MCC | Public MCC | Private MCC | Status |
| ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | `5_type_specific_thresholds.ipynb` | Type-Specific Thresh, Version 3 | 0.67650 | 0.65170 | 0.65127 | Current champion |
| 2 | `7_blended_type_models.ipynb` | Blended type models | 0.67944 | Pending | Pending | Submit challenger |
| 3 | `6_type_specific_models.ipynb` | Type-Specific Model, Version 2 | 0.67530 | 0.65212 | 0.64025 | Rejected: private regression |
| 4 | `4_nearest_player_and_smoothing.ipynb` | Nearest Player, Version 3 | 0.67455 | 0.64497 | 0.64763 | Superseded |
| 5 | `3_tracking_feature_model.ipynb` | Tracking Feature, Version 3 | 0.65310 | 0.63075 | 0.62593 | Superseded |

Notebook 5 improved over Notebook 4 by `+0.00673` public MCC and `+0.00364`
private MCC. The gain came mainly from improving player-player precision:
the best ground threshold stayed at `0.59`, while the best player-player
threshold moved to `0.70`.

Notebook 6 slightly improved public MCC but reduced private MCC by `0.01102`
versus Notebook 5, so Notebook 5 remains the selected scored champion.
Notebook 7 improved local MCC to `0.67944` by blending Notebook 5's stable
unified probabilities with Notebook 6's type-specific probabilities instead of
fully replacing the unified model.

## Key Takeaways

- MCC is the right decision metric. Accuracy is misleading because contact
  events are rare.
- Grouped validation by `game_play` is essential. Row-level random splits leak
  temporal and play context.
- Tracking data alone is already strong enough for a competitive baseline.
- Ground contact and player-player contact behave differently and should be
  evaluated separately.
- Temporal smoothing helps because labels and true contact events can shift
  across neighboring 10 Hz steps.
- The remaining weakness is ground-contact detection. Notebook 6 showed that a
  fully separate ground model was less stable, so Notebook 7 tests a blended
  version of that idea.
- The Team Hydrogen 2nd-place writeup suggests the next major gains come from
  temporal video crops, helmet interpolation, tracking features encoded with
  video context, and stage-2 blending. Notebook 8 starts with the lightweight
  version of that path.

## Lessons Learned

- Start with a submission-safe baseline before adding richer features.
- Keep notebook versions explicit. Each Kaggle run should print
  `NOTEBOOK_VERSION` before any expensive work starts.
- Preserve useful Kaggle outputs when the code has not changed; clear outputs
  only when they are stale or failed.
- Track public and private leaderboard scores beside local validation. Local
  MCC ranks experiments, while leaderboard scores confirm generalization.
- Small threshold changes can outperform larger model changes when the model
  is already well calibrated enough for ranking.

## Modeling Direction

The project has moved from a simple distance threshold to a stronger
tracking-feature pipeline:

1. Parse `contact_id` into play, step, and player identifiers.
2. Attach tracking features for player 1 and player 2.
3. Add pairwise distance, relative motion, nearest-player context, and
   prior-step dynamics.
4. Validate on held-out plays with natural class balance.
5. Tune hard thresholds with Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
6. Smooth probabilities within each play/contact-pair sequence.
7. Evaluate ground and player-player slices separately before submitting.

Next priority: submit Notebook 7 as the leaderboard challenger, then run
Notebook 8 with internet enabled to decide whether helmet/video features and
YOLO detections deserve a production model. Any final YOLO submission path
needs offline Kaggle inputs for packages and weights.
